Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student and developer exploring the vast world of technology

🎓 About Me
🏫 I'm currently a student at Voronezh State University (VSU), where I'm deepening my knowledge and skills in computer science.

💻 My primary programming language is C++, which I'm studying intensively to understand the fundamentals programming and software development.

🚀 I have a strong interest in expanding my expertise and plan to start learning 1C Enterprise development to explore business application platforms.

🎮 I'm also fascinated by game development. I'm exploring the possibility of creating my own games, from mechanics to storytelling, and I'm excited about the journey ahead.

⚽ Beyond the Code
My life isn't all about screens and code! I have a strong passion for other activities that keep me balanced and inspired:

Professional Football: I am dedicated to playing football (soccer) at a professional level. The discipline, teamwork, and strategy from sports greatly influence my approach to problem-solving in development.

Avid Reader: I love getting lost in books. My favorite genres are:

📖 Fantasy & Sci-Fi for the incredible worlds and ideas.

👻 Horror for the thrill and masterful suspense.

Socializing: I truly enjoy spending quality time outdoors, going for walks, and having great conversations with my friends. It's the best way to relax and recharge.

📈 Goals
I'm constantly looking to learn new technologies, contribute to interesting projects, and collaborate with other developers. My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer who can build efficient, reliable, and impactful software.
